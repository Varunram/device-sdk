%% Overview
\chapter{Embedded Device SDK}

Atonomi's Embedded Device SDK is a software library providing mechanisms to communicate
with the Atonomi network. Atonomi provides a network solution which tackles
the question of how to establish identity, trust, and reputation of IoT devices.
The blockchain-based approach allows companies to securely exchange services
and data to, from, and involving these devices.

The Embedded Device SDK provides a small-footprint code implementation of
messaging routines for communications between an IoT device and the Atonomi
Identity Registration Network (IRN). Aimed at embedded systems, this library
is intended to be easy to use, integrate, and deploy, and provides support
for vast numbers of SoCs and operating environments, especially those which
leverage ARM Cortex-M or Cortex-A IP cores.

The SDK supports three service endpoints: Activation, Validation, and Reputation.


\section{Terms}
The following terms are used throughout this document and associated source code.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A \textit{Protected Session (PS)} is a solution developed by CENTRI
		Technology which provides secure, encrypted communications between
		devices. Atonomi leverages this solution to secure sensitive
		data.
	\item A \textit{message} is a plaintext representation of some form of
		device-identifying information. These are secured directly via
		CENTRI Protected Sessions.
	\item The term \textit{envelope} is a container for data that is to be
		protected via a Protected Session. Envelopes are encrypted, fully
		secure, and contain no plaintext \textit{messages}. Plaintext
		\textit{messages} can be recovered, however, but only after
		the \textit{envelope} is decrypted (\textit{i.e.}, opened).
	\item Several bytes are prepended to the protected \textit{envelope} to
		form the Atonomi \textit{packet}. These \textit{packets} comprise
		the core messaging protocol between devices and Atonomi servers.
\end{itemize}


\section{Device Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developers are required to implement a callback to obtain random data from
a Hardware Random Number Generator.
	\item The SDK functions use up to four kilobytes (4096 bytes) of stack space.
		Developers are responsible for ensuring this space is available
		in order to prevent a stack overflow or stack-heap collision.
	\item errno-compatible declarations must be available. Developers may either
		include errno.h from a platform's libc, or instead use the provided
		atmi_errno.h file. The SDK is careful to restrict itself to those
		values which are consistent across all major UNIX platforms (Linux, BSD,
		Solaris, AIX, IRIX, etc.), so the source of errno declarations
		that is most convenient should be preferred.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} Any modifications to the SDK code, in whole or in part, may
result in a failure to successfully communicate with Atonomi servers.


\section{Public Repositories \&{} Project Layout}
The SDK is made available via a GitHub-hosted git repository
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/atonomi/device-sdk}},
where it can easily be cloned or otherwise downloaded for use.

The SDK is currently distributed as a pre-compiled static library for
various architectures, along with a header file providing a C language
API for use by developers to construct packetized messages for
the Atonomi network. All libraries are located within the
\texttt{lib/} subdirectory, and all include files are located within the
\texttt{include/} subdirectory. See table \ref{t:libatmi_arches} for more
details about supported platforms.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
	\textbf{ISA Family} & \textbf{Core Family} & \textbf{Provided Static Library} \\
	\hline
	\texttt{x86_64} & Intel/AMD (64-bit,SSE2)              & \texttt{libatmi-x64-X.Y.Z.a}    \\

	\texttt{armv7m} & Cortex-M, except -M0 (32-bit,Thumb2) & \texttt{libatmi-armv7m-X.Y.Z.a} \\
	\texttt{armv7a} & Cortex-A (32-bit,ARM)                & \texttt{libatmi-armv7a-X.Y.Z.a} \\
\end{tabular}

	\texttt{Y}, and \texttt{Z} indicate arbitrary numeric values which
	collectively denote the library's release version.}

\end{table}

A usage example of pack and unpack routines for an endpoint is present within
the \texttt{example/} subdirectory. Alongside this is a shell script which
uses the \texttt{curl} utility to demonstrate a successful HTTP transaction
with Atonomi servers and the receipt of a response to the submitted request.


\section{Endpoints \&{} HTTP}
The SDK allows one to pack and unpack messages into a secure bytestream
for transmission to and from Atonomi servers. Due to not every device
necessarily having a means of connecting directly to the Internet, no
means of performing this transfer are included in the SDK, and the developer
is responsible for providing the means to do this.

Communications are performed via a simple HTTP-based transaction mechanism
(HTTP version 1.1, specifically). A secure, packed message is provided to
Atonomi servers as the entire body of an HTTP PUT request, and the server
will return the corresponding secure, packed response as the body of an
HTTP 200 (OK) response. No special content encoding is required for the
HTTP transaction, and only two headers are required:
``\texttt{Content-Type:~application/octet-stream}'', and
``\texttt{Content-Length:~DDD}'', where \texttt{DDD} is the numeric length
of the packed request in bytes, expressed in base-10 decimal form.

Corresponding endpoint URLs for the supported request types are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\textbf{Action} & \textbf{Endpoint URL} \\
	\hline
	Activation & \texttt{http://device.atonomi.net/activation} \\
	Validation & \texttt{http://device.atonomi.net/validation} \\
	Reputation & \texttt{http://device.atonomi.net/reputation} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
